                            Both parties hereby agree that this EULA is the
                            entire and exclusive statement and legal
                            acknowledgement of the mutual understanding of the
                            parties and supersedes and cancels any previous
                            written and oral agreement and/or communication
                            relating to the subject matter of this EULA.
                            <br>
                            Severability
                            <br>
                            No delay or failure to exercise, on the part of
                            either party, any privilege, power or rights under
                            this EULA shall operate as a waiver of any of the
                            terms and provisions of this EULA. Accordingly, no
                            single or partial exercise of any right under this
                            Agreement shall preclude further exercise of any
                            other right under this EULA. Suppose any of the
                            outlined provisions of this EULA is deemed to be
                            unenforceable or invalid in whole or in part by a
                            court of competent jurisdiction. In that case, such
                            provision shall be limited to the minimum extent
                            necessary for this EULA to remain in full force and
                            effect and enforceable. The remaining provisions of
                            this Agreement shall not be rendered unenforceable
                            or invalid. They shall continue to be enforceable
                            and valid in isolation of the unenforceable and
                            invalid provisions of this EULA.

                            India Life Social, and author of this Software,
                            expressly disclaim any warranty for the India Life

                            without limitation, the implied warranties of
                            merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                            or non-infringement. Accordingly, the Licensee
                            accepts any risk arising out of the use or

                            <br>
                            Limited Liability
                            <br>
                            The Licensee agrees that the India Life Social shall
                            not be liable to Licensee, or any other related
                            person or entity claiming any loss of profits,
                            income, savings, or any other consequential,
                            incidental, special, punitive, direct or indirect
                            damage, whether arising in contract, tort, warranty,
                            or otherwise. Even if India Life Social has been
                            advised of the possibility of such damages. These
                            limitations shall necessarily apply regardless of
                            the primary purpose of any limited remedy. Under no
                            circumstances shall India Life Social aggregate
                            liability to the Licensee, or any other person or
                            entity claiming through the Licensee, exceed the
                            actual monetary amount paid by the Licensee to India

                            <br>
                            Entire Agreement
                            <br>

                            party in any action to enforce this EULA shall be
                            entitled to recover costs and expenses including,
                            without limitation, legal fees. Accordingly, this
