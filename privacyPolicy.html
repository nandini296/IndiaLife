                        buttons and/or icons that you can embed on other
                        sites/services to track the website addresses where they

                        campaign updates, or other ongoing email communications
                        from CC), we may use certain analytics tools, such as
                        clear GIFs, to capture data such as whether you open our
                        message, click on any links or banners our email
                        contains, or otherwise interact with what we send. This
                        data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our
                        communications and marketing campaigns. As we adopt

                        are sold or transferred to a third party, customer

                        <br>
                        Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data
                        <br>
                        The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell
                        you about the legal ground they rely on to use or
                        disclose information that can be directly linked to or
                        used to identify you. To the extent those laws apply,
                        our legal grounds for processing such information are as
                        follows:
                        <br>
                        To Honor Our Contractual Commitments to You.
                        <br>
                        Much of our processing of information is to meet our
                        contractual obligations to provide services to our
                        users.
                        <br>
                        Legitimate Interests.
                        <br>
                        In many cases, we handle information on the ground that
                        it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are
                        not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights
                        and freedoms of the affected individuals, these include:

                        interests of our users and business partners.

                        We may need to use and disclose information in certain
                        ways to comply with our legal obligations.
                        <br>

                        <br>

                        legally permissible, we handle information on the basis
                        of consent. Where we handle your information on the
                        basis of consent, you have the right to withdraw your
                        consent; in accordance with applicable law.

                        <br>
                        We may use third-party web analytics services (such as

                        analytics technologies described in the “Cookies and

                        disclosed to or collected directly by these service
                        providers, who use the information to evaluate your use
                        of the Services, including by noting the third-party
                        website from which you arrive to our Site, analyzing
                        usage trends, assisting with fraud prevention, and
                        providing certain features to you. To prevent Google
                        Analytics from using your information for analytics, you
                        may install the official Google Analytics Opt-out

                        <br>
                        As described above in the “When We Disclose Your
                        Information” section, we may share your information with
                        trusted service providers or business partners in
                        countries other than your country of residence in
                        accordance with applicable law. This means that some of
                        your information may be processed in countries that may
                        not offer the same level of protection as the privacy
                        laws of your jurisdiction. By providing us with your
                        information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage
                        or use.
                        <br>
                        If we provide any information about you to any third
                        parties information processors located outside of the
                        EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such
                        companies protect your information adequately in
                        accordance with this Privacy Policy and other data

                        Security Measures
                        <br>
                        We have implemented technical, physical, and
                        organizational security measures to protect against the
                        loss, misuse, and/or alteration of your information.
                        These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the
                        information that we collect and store. However, we
                        cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will
                        prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or
                        disclose your information since despite our efforts, no
                        Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be
                        completely secure.

                        information (as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy
